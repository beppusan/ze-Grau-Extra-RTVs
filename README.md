## FAQ

### Why is there no RTV-Ex?

A. I'm currently reworking it.

### Are you planning to add more RTV stages?

A. Yes. I'm considering porting the stage called `RTV-Plus` and creating two other RTV stages at the moment.

### Can you port this to CS2?

A. Yes, but it will take some time. I'm not familiar with CS2 mapping and stripper, so I need to learn how they work in the game from scratch. I am also planning to port these scripts to CS:S. I already know that koen has ported all RTV stages to CS:S (and Garry's Mod), but I plan to work on it personally.
